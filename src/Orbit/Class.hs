-- This is the main meat of the package. The Orbit typeclass, it gives us ways
-- to manipulate nominal elements in sets and maps. The type class has
-- associated data to represent an orbit of type a. This is often much easier
-- than the type a itself. For example, all orbits of Rat are equal.
-- Furthermore, we provide means to go back and forth between elements and
-- orbits, and we get to know their support size. For many manipulations we
-- need an Ord instance on the associated data type, this can often be
-- implemented, even when the type 'a' does not have an Ord instance.
--
-- Laws / conditions:
-- * index . toOrbit == size . support
-- * getElement o s is defined if index o == Set.size s
